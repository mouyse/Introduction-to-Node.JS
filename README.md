# Introduction-to-Node.JS

Taking the course from edX to get a basic understanding of NodeJS

Introduction to Node.js (LFW111x)

Course Overview

As the language of the Internet browser, JavaScript is ubiquitous and Node.js is an
asynchronous, event-driven, JavaScript runtime. Software engineers from all backgrounds have
touched JavaScript at some point. Using a common-place, easy-to-learn language as the basis
of a runtime environment for manipulating machine I/O has some interesting and wide-ranging
productivity benefits.

Node.js has qualities that can make it particularly useful in various scenarios. From
service-mocking, rapid-prototyping and real-time applications to building Command Line
Interfaces in a short time to accessing a plethora of ecosystem utilities. This course allows the
learner to learn about the fundamentals of Node.js and discover ways it can help in everyday
computing scenarios.

Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:
● Rapidly build command line tools.
● Rapidly mock RESTful JSON APIs.
● Rapidly prototype real-time services.
● Discover and use ecosystem utilities.
